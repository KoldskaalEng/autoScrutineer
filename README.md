# autoScrutineer

## Description 
Script for automatic scrutineering in MVRC.

This automated scrutineering requires a particular submission folder structure. stls are now to be places inside the folder corresponing to the names given in the official rules. For example: all the parts belonging to the frontwing are to be placed in the frontwing folder. It is ok to place multiple stls in each folder.  

Be aware that faces that are coincident with the surfaces of the referencevolumes might be considered illegal, due to "z-flickering". It is adviced that you stay a few mm clear of the reference volume boundaries. 

## Checking one submission
Run the script in a folder containing the following: 
* referenceGeometry folder with all RV's and RS's
* submission folder as per description above 
* rules.txt file downloaded from official MVRC sources
* submissionRepackaging.txt downloaded from official MVRC sources 

## Checking multiple submissions
_we are checking._ 

## Submission folder

## Todo: 
* implement a neat way to check multiple submissions.
